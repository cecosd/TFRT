I decided to use WPS Hide Login plugin to change administration URL, because it is simple, secure and suitable with PHP 7+. I used Polylang plugin for translations, because it works good with Loco translate plugin and they both together gave me ability to translate every string that I needed. Using Contact 7 and Easy WP SMTP plugins connection, instead of coding SMTP mail sender contact form saved my time and did not appear on quality of task. For captcha I used one of the most simple and trustable source. For homepage I made filtering and sorting using Ajax method. Sorted/filtered movies are placed in the sliding row. I mostly use Swiper slide, which is completely open-source and simple, so did I in this case. I made only small layout changes on movie taxanomy page. I tried to add as less coding in function.php as possible.
